                people who live on the Surma-Kushiyara riverâ€™s bank of Bangladesh. Below are some of the ways we are
                helping the affected people

                        More than 50 thounsands people are affected by the flash flood. We are working to help them by
                        providing them dry food like rice, puffed rice, biscuits, pure drinking water, etc.
